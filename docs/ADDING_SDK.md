# Adding the SDK

To start processing payments, you need to add the Extension Buddy SDK to your browser extension. The SDK facilitates on-demand payment and login windows and manages user states.

**Note**: If you're using an Extension Buddy Template, the SDK is already included, so you can move on to the next steps.
