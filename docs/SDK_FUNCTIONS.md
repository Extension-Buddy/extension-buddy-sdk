## Functions

#### `getUserStatus()`

Check if the current user is logged in and has access to t he current extension. When this function is called, it will return an object detailing what access it has. This response could be used to handle complex access.

```javascript
const userStatus = await sdk.getUserStatus();

console.log(userStatus.logged_in); 
// true
```
<b>Response:</b>
```javascript
{
  "logged_in": true,
  "status": "active",
  "user": {
    "created_at": "2023-10-23T05:28:16.788Z",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
  },
  "plans": {
    "plan_tBSO7SqIqkTeI9UzngFh": {
      "key": "plan_tBSO7SqIqkTeI9UzngFh",
      "name": "Test Plan",
      "type": "monthly",
      "is_active": true
    }
  }
}
```

`userStatus.status` can either be `"active"` | `"not_active"`. It will only be active if at least one plan is active.
